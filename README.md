# Danilo Costa — Personal Portfolio

Personal portfolio built with React and Vite, showcasing my work as a full-stack developer, industrial designer, and former dentist. The goal of this project is to have a clean, fast, and professional online presence to support my job search in Montreal.

## About the Project

This portfolio is designed around one key idea: my career path is unusual, and that is a strength. Instead of a single generic developer portfolio, this project presents three distinct versions of my professional profile, each with its own visual identity and content focus.

- **Developer version** — the main page, showcasing web development projects. Minimal and modern style with a cream background and sage green accents.
- **Industrial Designer version** — focused on CAD, 3D modeling, and automation work. Technical and precise style inspired by engineering blueprints, with a dark background and orange accents.
- **Dentist version** — tells the story of my clinical career in Brazil.

Each version has its own navigation, layout, and color palette.

## Tech Stack

- React with Vite
- Tailwind CSS v4
- shadcn/ui for components
- Framer Motion for animations
- React Router DOM for navigation
- Resend or EmailJS for the contact form
- Deployed on Vercel

## Features

## Why Vercel

The previous version of this portfolio was hosted on Render with a free plan, which caused slow load times due to server sleep. Vercel solves this completely for static and React projects — instant loading, clean custom domain, and free hosting.

## Background

I am a former dentist from Brazil who transitioned into web development after moving to Montreal. I also have a background in industrial design and CAD modeling. I completed my Web Development degree at College Maisonneuve and did my internship at Riopel Consultant, a Microsoft-certified IT firm in Saint-Jerome, where I worked on PHP backends, ConnectWise API integrations, and internal portal development.

This portfolio is a long-term project. I plan to expand it with CAD automation work using Python and AutoCAD as I develop those skills.
