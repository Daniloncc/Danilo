            "approach": "I started by defining the main user flows (sign up, add a wine, filtering, profile), then produced low-fidelity wireframes to validate the structure with the team.

            "approach": "Rather than designing from scratch in a design tool, I referenced three different Bootstrap templates and blended them together, adding my own personal customizations to achieve a distinctive and coherent look. Once the visual direction was established, I set up the Laravel framework with migrations, models, and Blade views, using Twig to manage template variables.
